A study of data gathered from Smartphone accelerometers can be found here

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

This study used 30 subjects and examined various smartphone measurements when the subjects were carrying the following activities
	
Activity:
	WALKING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	SITTING
	STANDING
	LAYING

Many variables were recorded from the smartphones, but this further study (this git project), is only interested in the mean and standard deviation variables.
These variables are as follows

 [1] tBodyAcc-mean()-X           tBodyAcc-mean()-Y           tBodyAcc-mean()-Z           tGravityAcc-mean()-X

[57] fBodyAccJerk-std()-X        fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y        fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z        fBodyGyro-std()-X          
[61] fBodyGyro-std()-Y           fBodyGyro-std()-Z           fBodyAccMag-std()           fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()  
[65] fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()      fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std() 


For each of the above variables, the final dataset consists of the mean value for all measurements taken for a combination of activity and subject

Columns 1 and 2 of the final data set are 

Activity - This is one of the 6 activities mentioned 
Subject - This is the number allocated to the experiment participants.  This is numbered 1..30
The remaining 66 columns in each row, contain the average value for each measurement taked for a subject's activity, in the order defined above
